_How inspirational are inspirational quotes anyways?_

# About me

Hi, nice to meet you!

My name is **Angela Zhang**. 

I'm an incoming first year student at the _University of Waterloo_, studying Computer Science. 

[Check out my blog!](./another-page.html)

## Interests & Hobbies

Aside from CS, I'm interested in molecular genetics and developmental biology.
In my free time, I like to play Go, chess, and board games with friends. 
I also enjoy cross country skiing, creative writing, and art.

### Update

Right now, I'm a summer student in a stem cell/embryology lab in Toronto. I'm learning a lot about how research is conducted and the equipment and protocols that lead to scientific discovery. 

In a very strange way, following a protocol is a lot like cooking.
